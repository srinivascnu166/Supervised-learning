Any Learning involves the following steps:
    
    
               1)Data Preprocessing
               2)Selecting the best ML-model
               3)Visualizing the data
               4)predecting the outcome of the model





This is a simple Linear Regression code using python.

         A simple linear regressor is of the form: y=ax+b
         
                                              where y-dependent variable
                                                    x-independent variable
               
               
It involves step by step procedure to build a simple Linear Regression Model which Predects the Salary Of the CEO.

step-1:.........................IMPORTING LIBRARIES............................. 

Pythons Offers Different Libraries which makes the coding easy.They are:
          
                               a)Pandas library
                               b)scikit-learn library
                               c)Numpy library
                               d)matplotlib library

step-2:..........................Data Preprocessing.............................

It involves the splitting the data and dividing it into dependent and independent variables.
